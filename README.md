# Employee and Project Management System

A full-stack web application developed for the management of employees, projects, their assignments, and statistical analysis based on the data.

The system is divided into the following main components:

- **Frontend** – Vue.js app with Vuetify and Pinia
- **Backend** – Java Spring Boot REST API
- **Database** – MySQL
- **Statistics Module** – Python scripts using Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis

Each main directory (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `python/`, `db/`) contains its own `README.md` with detailed information on setup and usage.
